Overview
--------

All HDFS commands are invoked by the `bin/hdfs` script. Running the hdfs script without any arguments prints the description for all commands.

Usage: `hdfs [SHELL_OPTIONS] COMMAND [GENERIC_OPTIONS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]`

The command will fail if datanode is still serving the block pool. Refer to refreshNamenodes to shutdown a block pool service on a datanode. |
| `-setBalancerBandwidth` \<bandwidth in bytes per second\> | Changes the network bandwidth used by each datanode during HDFS block balancing. \<bandwidth\> is the maximum number of bytes per second that will be used by each datanode.
