Overview
--------

YARN commands are invoked by the bin/yarn script. Running the yarn script without any arguments prints the description for all commands.

Usage: `yarn [--config confdir] COMMAND [--loglevel loglevel] [GENERIC_OPTIONS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]`

YARN has an option parsing framework that employs parsing generic options as well as running classes.

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| `--config confdir` | Overwrites the default Configuration directory. Default is `${HADOOP_PREFIX}/conf`. |
| `--loglevel loglevel` | Overwrites the log level. Valid log levels are FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE. Default is INFO. |
| GENERIC\_OPTIONS | The common set of options supported by multiple commands. See the Hadoop [Commands Manual](../../hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CommandsManual.html#Generic_Options) for more information. |
| COMMAND COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Various commands with their options are described in the following sections. The commands have been grouped into [User Commands](#User_Commands) and [Administration Commands](#Administration_Commands). |

| -containerId \<ContainerId\> | ContainerId (must be specified if node address is specified) |
| -help | Help |
| -nodeAddress \<NodeAddress\> | NodeAddress in the format nodename:port (must be specified if container id is specified) |

Dump the container logs

### `node`

Usage: `yarn node [options] `

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| -all | Works with -list to list all nodes. |
| -list | Lists all running nodes. Supports optional use of -states to filter nodes based on node state, and -all to list all nodes. |
| -states \<States\> | Works with -list to filter nodes based on input comma-separated list of node states. |
| -status \<NodeId\> | Prints the status report of the node. |

Prints node report(s)

   yarn daemonlog -setlevel <host:httpport> <classname> <level>
```

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| -getlevel `<host:httpport>` `<classname>` | Prints the log level of the log identified by a qualified `<classname>`, in the daemon running at `<host:httpport>`. This command internally connects to `http://<host:httpport>/logLevel?log=<classname>` |
| -setlevel `<host:httpport> <classname> <level>` | Sets the log level of the log identified by a qualified `<classname>` in the daemon running at `<host:httpport>`. This command internally connects to `http://<host:httpport>/logLevel?log=<classname>&level=<level>` |

Get/Set the log level for a Log identified by a qualified class name in the daemon.

Example: `$ bin/yarn daemonlog -setlevel 127.0.0.1:8088 org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.rmapp.RMAppImpl DEBUG`
