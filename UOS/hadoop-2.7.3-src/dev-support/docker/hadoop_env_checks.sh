Apparently you are inside this docker container as the user root.
Putting it simply:

   This should not occur.

Known possible causes of this are:
1) Running this script as the root user ( Just don't )
2) Running an old docker version ( upgrade to 1.4.1 or higher )

Your system is running on very little memory.
This means it may work but it wil most likely be slower than needed.

If you are running this via boot2docker you can simply increase
the available memory to atleast ${MINIMAL_MEMORY_GiB} GiB (you have $((INSTALLED_MEMORY/(1024*1024))) GiB )
