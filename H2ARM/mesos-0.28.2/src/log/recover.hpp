// makes may contradict its lost votes, leading to potential
// inconsistency in the log. Instead, the replica should be put in
// non-voting status and catch up missing positions (and associated
// Paxos states). The replica can be re-allowed to vote if the
// following two conditions are met: 1) a sufficient amount of missing
// positions are recovered such that if other replicas fail, the
// remaining replicas can restore all the successfully written log
// entries; 2) its future votes cannot not contradict its lost votes.
//
// This function returns an owned pointer to the recovered replica if
// the recovery is successful. If the auto-initialization flag is set,
// an empty replica will be allowed to vote if ALL replicas (i.e.,
// quorum * 2 - 1) are empty. This allows us to bootstrap the
// replicated log without explicitly using an initialization tool.
