MapReduce NextGen aka YARN aka MRv2
===================================

The new architecture introduced in hadoop-0.23, divides the two major functions of the JobTracker: resource management and job life-cycle management into separate components.

The new ResourceManager manages the global assignment of compute resources to applications and the per-application ApplicationMaster manages the applicationâ€™s scheduling and coordination.

An application is either a single job in the sense of classic MapReduce jobs or a DAG of such jobs.

The ResourceManager and per-machine NodeManager daemon, which manages the user processes on that machine, form the computation fabric.

The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework specific library and is tasked with negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the tasks.

More details are available in the [Architecture](./YARN.html) document.
